var visibility = window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('footer')).visibility;
liveCode.footerVisibleHandler(visibility);

Certainly! The JavaScript line you've provided can be broken down into the following steps:

1. `document.querySelector('footer')`: This function selects the first HTML element that matches the specified selector, in this case, 'footer'. It's similar to how you would use CSS selectors. If there is a `<footer>` element in the document, this function will return that element.

2. `window.getComputedStyle(...)`: This function is called with the previously selected `footer` element as its argument. It returns an object that contains all the styles applied to that element after all the CSS rules have been applied. This is the computed style of the element, which is the final set of styles that are actually used to display the element on the page.

3. `.visibility`: This property is then accessed on the object returned from `getComputedStyle`. The `visibility` style property is a specific CSS property that can have values like 'hidden', 'visible', or 'collapse'. By accessing this property, you're retrieving the value of the visibility for the `footer` element.

4. `liveCode.footerVisibleHandler(...)`: Finally, the value of the `visibility` property is passed as an argument to the `footerVisibleHandler` function. `liveCode` is an object that provides a way for JavaScript within the browser widget to communicate with LiveCode. `footerVisibleHandler` is a handler that has been previously set up in LiveCode to receive messages (with `set the javascriptHandlers of me to "footerVisibleHandler"`) from the JavaScript context.

The whole line effectively says, "Get the visibility of the `footer` element and send that value to the `footerVisibleHandler` function within LiveCode." It's a way to bridge the gap between JavaScript in the browser widget and LiveCode script, allowing the latter to react according to the visibility of the footer element on the web page.
