/*
These handdlers manipulate the hTable format returned by the native revAvailableHandlers property of LiveCode.
In general the handlers loop through the table looking for matches.
We distingusish between the following forms of search:
- Exact matches ("Exact")
- Match either provate handlers of public handlers ("Either")
-Flexibly match nadlers the same way Livecode calls them - ie don't distinguish "on" and "command" ("Flexible")

The "Flexible" handlers are not fully tested, and the logic might be not quite right.
